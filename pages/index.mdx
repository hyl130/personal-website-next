Hi, I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My primary technical languages are Java and Python. I have several experiences with C++, JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

When I am not coding, I'm probably exploring new places and taking pictures. I love listening to music and dancing during my free time!
